His novel The Shadows of Windermere became an instant classic, earning him both fame and fortune. But just as quickly as he rose to prominence, Hale vanished from the public eye. His reclusive lifestyle in Windermere House, a decaying mansion perched on the edge of a fog-choked lake, only added to his mystique.

Several months after he retreated into solitude, his body was discovered in Windermere House under disturbing circumstances. Authorities found the remains disfigured and unrecognizable, having fallen from a top-floor window. The months of decay and the impact of the fall had left the body ravaged, shrouding the truth in mystery.

Fifty years later, strange rumors are still circulating about his untimely end, the house, and the book that made him famous.

You, a young &#39;&#39;journalist&#39;&#39; (or writer?) with a passion for solving the unsolvable, have come to Windermere House. Something about the case has always bothered you—the lack of clear answers, the gaps in the story. Now, you’re determined to uncover the truth.

As you approach Windermere House, the air carries a faint, almost delicate scent of lavender, lingering just beneath the damp, earthy smell of the overgrown grounds. There&#39;s no lavender in sight, no flowers blooming among the tangled weeds or near the crumbling stone walls, yet the fragrance lingers, unsettling.

You step through the rusted iron gates, the faint echo of your footsteps swallowed by the stillness. Somewhere, a crow caws, its cry thin and haunting.

There is something here—something watching, waiting. You take a big breath and push the door of the house. 

You enter and close the door behind you. The house is silent, as if resting. The spacious hallway is slightly dark and the air dusty. The walls are empty and there is no furniture. You make a few steps. The old wooden floorboards creak underfoot, their groans echoing through the empty corridors of the house. Ahead, a narrow staircase winds its way to the first floor. To the right, the kitchen.

The ghost looms closer, its figure slowly taking shape in the dim light. The air around you feels heavy, as if pressing down on your chest, making it harder to breathe. Long, tattered robes drag behind it, whispering faintly as they sweep across the floor. Its face is a pale, twisted mask of sorrow and rage, the features barely visible yet unmistakably filled with anguish. You can feel its gaze locking onto you, even though its eyes seem more like dark hollows. The scent of lavender floods your senses, overpowering, suffocating.

A deep chill settles into your bones as the ghost stops just a few feet away, unmoving. A low, rasping sound fills the room, a voice that seems to come from everywhere at once. It speaks slowly, each word dripping with bitterness and pain, though the message is fragmented, impossible to piece together. Despite the confusion, you can sense its anger. The cold creeps up your spine, and your heart races in your chest.

The walls seem to close in as the presence of the ghost grows more intense. It doesn’t move, but the room feels smaller, the air colder. Your pulse pounds in your ears as the ghost’s voice scratches at your thoughts, demanding something, accusing someone. It&#39;s waiting for you to act, but what does it want?

As you run your fingers across the volumes, you can feel the grit of dust and time. Most of the books seem untouched for years, their subjects ranging from obscure literary works to dense volumes on esoteric philosophy. 

The titles are barely legible on some, worn away by the passage of years, but one book stands out among the sea of forgotten texts. 
It&#39;s a manuscript. The one that launched Gregory Hale to fame: //The Shadows of Windermere//. At the sight of it, your heart skips a beat. 

As you&#39;re about to reach for the book , ~~something else catches your eyes,~~ a glare catches your attention your attention again, high up on the shelf. 

It&#39;s a small dusty photograph, its golden frame catching the &#39;&#39;dim&#39;&#39; light of the oil lamp. The old picture shows two men side by side, posing together in a familiar manner. The dust is thick, but you seem to recognise one of the men as Hale.

You ascend the grand staircase to the second floor, following the creaking floorboards.
As you slowly climb, you start hearing the deep sound of a clock ticking, echoing in the whole house, growing louder and louder. A heavy chill fills the space, and the atmosphere presses down on you like a weight.

You reached the top of the stairs. The gongs of the clock are now terribly loud and ominous. Two doors stand tall in front of you, and the relentless sound seems to come from the room on the left.

The juxtaposition of this eerie order and the knowledge of the violent fall from the window makes your skin prickle with unease.

The bed has nothing to offer out of the ordinary, and you instinctively turn to the nightstand and the lonely cup. Its contents has long since dried, but the faint, lingering scent of lavender still clings to it. It feels as though someone had been staying here—perhaps even prepared to spend the night—before tragedy struck. 

A chill runs down your spine. The air grows colder, and suddenly, you feel a presence behind you. Turning around, there is nothing, no one. But the silence is heavier than before.

Turning back your attention to the cup, you extend your arm to take it into your hand. That&#39;s when you see it. A faint figure standing in the corner of the room—its face pale and indistinct, its form shimmering in and out of focus. 

A cold, heavy silence fills the room, and the ghost slowly reaches out toward you.

The ghost lingers, its pale, twisted face watching you in silence, waiting. You swallow hard and speak, your voice trembling.

“I know the truth,” you say, hoping to calm the spirit. “I know about James Thorpe. He was your ghostwriter. He wrote The Shadows of Windermere but became bitter when you got all the recognition. He couldn’t handle it. He—he killed you out of jealousy, didn’t he? That’s why you’re trapped here. I understand now. Thorpe was envious of your success, and he took it too far.”

You pause, hoping your words have eased the tension in the air, but the ghost remains silent. The cold seems to intensify, and for a moment, you think you see its form tremble. You wait, expecting relief, but the weight of its gaze only grows heavier.

The marks are deep, frantic, like a last-ditch effort to grasp at something before it was too late. A cold breeze wafts through the crack, carrying with it stronger hints of the oddly soothing lavender&#39;s scent.

&#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;In previous passage: Redondant then?
Your eyes are immediately drawn to the large window, slightly cracked open, its dusty panes barely letting in the dim light from the moon outside. The floor beneath the window is scuffed, the marks faint but clear, leading toward the sill. &#39;&#39;&#39;&#39;</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="11" name="Helping the Ghost" tags="" position="2450,525" size="100,100">You agree to help Thorpe. The weight of his story presses down on you, and as you gather the evidence—letters, drafts, and Thorpe’s own fragmented memories—it all begins to make sense. Gregory Hale, the celebrated author, had invited James Thorpe to Windermere House under the pretense of discussing how to share the credit for The Shadows of Windermere. But that night, Hale’s intentions were far darker.

Thorpe, eager for the recognition he deserved, had stayed in the guestroom, unaware of the betrayal that awaited him. Hale, with practiced deceit, brought Thorpe a cup of lavender tea, the delicate floral scent masking the deadly poison laced within. As Thorpe sipped the tea,~~ the lavender&#39;s sweetness covered the bitterness beneath,~~ and his body slowly succumbed. The lavender had always been part of Windermere House’s atmosphere, its scent lingering even in death, but that night it became part of Hale’s cruel plan to cover the truth.

Once Thorpe was dead, Hale carried out the next stage of his twisted scheme. He threw Thorpe’s lifeless body out of the guestroom window, leaving it to be battered and broken beyond recognition. When authorities eventually found the body, Hale had already fled, leaving behind the assumption that it was his own corpse, disfigured beyond identification. Hale had erased Thorpe’s identity and stolen his life’s work, vanishing into the world with Thorpe’s story as his own. In his vanity, he had prefered to disapear from the public eye rather than risking ruining his fame, while his so-called mysterious death would keep his name alive for decades.


[[Leave Windermere House-&gt;Justice for the Ghost]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="12" name="Justice for the Ghost" tags="" position="2600,525" size="100,100">You expose Hale’s crime to the world by piecing together the truth in a chilling narrative of ambition, betrayal, and murder. The letters, the evidences, and the haunting presence of Thorpe himself give life to the tale that no one had ever known. 

The literary community is shattered. Hale’s reputation, once revered, crumbles under the weight of his deceit, and his name is forever disgraced.

&#39;&#39;After publishing the book, you come back only once to the Windermere House&#39;&#39;. In your final, quiet moments in the &#39;&#39;house&#39;&#39;, the ghost of James Thorpe appears one last time, his face no longer twisted in rage or sorrow. He looks at you with a nod of silent gratitude, and then, like the mist that had always surrounded Windermere House, he vanishes into the night, finally at peace.

The book you’ve written becomes an instant success. No fame for you however; you published the book under Thorpe&#39;s name.

In your final, quiet moments in the house, the ghost of James Thorpe appears one last time, his face no longer twisted in rage or sorrow.

The wind outside seems to grow stronger, whistling through the crack. You press your face closer to the glass, squinting to see through the mist that covers the windowpane.

Suddenly, without warning, the wood beneath your hands gives way with a sharp crack. The window swings open violently, and before you can react, you are thrown forward, tumbling out of the window. Your scream is swallowed by the howling wind as the ground rushes up to meet you. The world spins in a blur.

You step into what you can only assume is the guest bedroom.
The bed is made, though the linens are old and brittle, &#39;&#39;as if they’d been prepared long ago but never used.&#39;&#39; A detail catches your attention. A single cup sits on the small nightstand.

There’s something here—a strange stillness, as if time itself stopped the moment the room was last used. That&#39;s when you realise the sound of the clock has stopped, leaving the place in a deep silence.

The bannister is smooth and polished, though the wood beneath your hand feels cold, almost damp to the touch. Each step you take reverberates through the stillness, as if the house itself is listening.

Reaching the landing, you pause for a moment, your breath catching in your throat. Before you, one large imposing door. Further down on the landing, to the right of the first door, a smaller one. At the end of the landing, the stairs go up.

As you ponder whether to keep going up or not, the big door in front of you creaks softly  — as if inviting you in.

With one last glance down the shadowed corridor, you approach the door, the smell of old paper and faded ink wafting from the darkened room beyond.

The heavy oak table in the center of the room is scarred with deep cuts, likely from decades of use. 

It&#39;s so cold here—you wish you could make some tea. While shaking off your body to warm you up a little, your eyes lay on the counter, where you notice an old teapot.~~ ready to brew a final pot of tea.~~

Your hands shaking a little, you grab its handle, and open the lid. 

~~The tea leftover is not smelling good, rather bitter and muddy. What would you expect from a 50 years old teapot?~~ The teapot is empty, but you can still smell a lavender scent emanating from it. As you breath in, you close your eyes and try to imagine the life of Gregory Hale while writing The Shadows of Windermere. How did it feel to write a book that was instantly recognised as a masterpiece? You hope someday to write something that will have an impact too.

As you open your eyes again, the room is slightly spinning in front of your eyes. You find the closest chair and sit there for a while, breathing slowly. You were not expecting today to feel so intense, but the house&#39;s atmosphere seems heavy. 

A few breaths later, feeling better, you decide to start your exploration.



[[Search the kitchen]] 


~~TODO: TU RENIFLES ET CA PUE, ça tangue et tu t&#39;asseies~~ DONE

~~You motion closer to the teapot. Despite the layer of dust, it seems oddly inviting, as if it had been left out for you. You hesitate for a moment, but the kitchen is SUPER TODO cold, and the idea of a hot cup of tea is strangely comforting.

~~You pour yourself a cup, feeling a small measure of warmth spread through your fingers as you hold the delicate porcelain. You take a slow sip, the taste soothing in its familiarity. For a moment, you feel more at ease. But then, your throat tightens. 

Panic grips you as your breathing becomes labored. Your hands shake, and the cup shatters on the floor. The room spins violently, your vision narrowing to a pinprick of light as your chest burns with a searing pain.

You collapse to the cold floor, gasping for breath, your limbs growing weaker by the second. In your final moments, you realize: the tea was poisoned.  You let your guard down in a place of decay and death. Some comforts in Windermere House are deadly.~~

There’s nothing particularly useful, though the cobwebs and layers of dust make it clear that no one has used this place in years.

Satisfied there’s nothing more to find here, you turn back and exit the kitchen.

The small photograph is just out of reach, but something about it beckons you. You glance around and spot a small, rickety wooden stool nearby. You decide to stand on it to reach the mysterious picture. Carefully balancing on the stool, you stretch your arm toward the top shelf.

The last thing you hear is the sound of the frame hitting the floor and bursting into pieces beside you. 
Far away, you hear the sinister sound of a clock ticking.

&#39;&#39;You died in the most mundane way possible&#39;&#39;(is it though?) —toppled by too much curiosity and a wobbly stool—the identity of the second man in the photograph staying a secret out of reach. &#39;&#39;The groundbreaking novel you wanted to write, never even started. &#39;&#39;Perhaps next time, you&#39;ll think twice before reaching for something you can’t quite grasp.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="21" name="The Shadows of Windermere" tags="" position="1275,525" size="100,100">You disregard the photograph and go back to the precious manuscript.

You flip through the pages and find strange markings in the margins, in a small and fast handwritting. Notes taken by someone discovering the manuscript. Who would have had access to the manuscript and add these remarks and questions?
As you reach the end, you are not sure what to think.

As you keep groing through the pages, something falls from the end of the book. As you look on the ground, you find an cumpled enveloppe.

Do you think I’m some kind of fool? That I’ll just sit by and let you walk away with everything? Your silence tells me all I need to know. &#39;&#39;You’re not even sorry.&#39;&#39; You’ve been hiding, avoiding me, but you can’t avoid what’s coming.

But you can&#39;t finish the reading. The ink has faded, leaving the end of the letter and the name of the sender unknown. You pause, the weight of the sender’s fury still seeping into your mind. Someone was very angry at Hale. What did he do to generate such hatred? 

As you pause, something bright in the bookshelves catches your attention in the corner of your eyes.

Hale—

I’ve stayed quiet long enough, but I won’t anymore. 
You promised me recognition. You swore my name would be there, on the title page, right beside yours. But I see now what you’ve done. You’ve taken everything we worked on—everything I wrote—and claimed it for yourself. It’s my work, Hale, not yours. Do you even feel a shred of guilt when people call you a genius?
I’m sick of living in your shadow, of pretending like this arrangement is fair. I wrote The Shadows of Windermere, every last word of it. You know it, I know it, and soon the world will too. You owe me what’s mine.

I expect a response, and soon.

Could &#39;&#39;the original Shadows of Windermere manuscript&#39;&#39; have really been written by this man, and only the markings in the manuscript actually be from Hale? 

In the timespan between the 2 letters, Thorpe’s anger had escalated to something dark. It’s clear that this man wasn’t just demanding recognition—he was threatening Hale. 
Did Thorpe mean to harm Hale? Did this rivalry escalate into something worse than just a stolen manuscript?

You decide to keep exploring.

Your instincts scream at you to leave—to get out while you still can.

You make your way back through the dim hallway, the floorboards groaning beneath your feet like some long-forgotten warning. Suddenly, un son sourd. la flamme de la lampe s&#39;éteint. vous sortez de la pièce, le coeur battant.

The staircase that once seemed so innocuous now looms ahead, the shadows deeper, the air colder. The strange scent of lavender clings to you, more oppressive now. Your steps quicken, a rising sense of dread clawing at your chest. You grip the banister, its wood slick and clammy, and descend with deliberate speed. You need to get out—now.~~


[[Look for clues upstairs-&gt;The Staircase]] </tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="25" name="The landing" tags="" position="1900,1100" size="100,100">You hit the ground with a sickening thud, your body broken by the fall. Pain shoots through every limb, and your vision starts to blur. As the darkness closes in, you catch a glimpse just to your left—a large, overgrown lavender shrub swaying gently in the breeze. 

If you&#39;d fallen just a bit to the side, you realize, you might have landed on it and survived. A bitter thought flickers in your mind: the house seems to be mocking you, ensuring you met your end just out of reach of safety.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="26" name="Leave with a story" tags="" position="2500,800" size="100,100">You came here for a story. This will be your masterpiece. An investigation about friendship, treason, and ghosts. The novel you will write will change your life, you can feel it. With one last look at the ghost of James Thorpe, you head back to the door.

As you turn the doorknob, a wave of freezing cold washes over you, ~~the lavender scent suddenly overwhelming, ~~~~as if the very air is ~~choking you with its sweet, suffocating fragrance. Panic grips you as the ghost’s hand reaches out, cold and unnatural. He seems trying to say something. You are not here to converse with a ghost. Without thinking, you bolt for the stairs, your heart pounding in your chest. 

Disoriented, ~~you stumble into the hallway, gasping for breath. Your vision blurs, and your legs feel heavy. Alors que vous réunissez vos forces pour fuir, ~~your left foot miss the first step, and you lose balance. Your body rolled down the stairs like a rag doll, and your head hit the ground.
~~Confused, you try to push forward, but your body refuses to move.~~

The smell of lavender thickens, clinging to your skin, while you understand too late that the ghost never intend to kill you. He only wanted to talk. ~~your lungs, suffocating you from the insid~~e. You collapse in your blood, and as darkness closes in, you realise your masterpiece will never see the light, lost because your own greed.




~~you’re no longer running from the ghost—you’ve become one with it, claimed by its lingering curse.~~

~~The ghost and you are now one. You can&#39;t figure out where your body and his are starting and ending. ~~ / The ghost is flying/passing though you.~~

Disoriented, you stumble into the hallway, gasping for breath. Your vision blurs, and your legs feel heavy. Alors que vous réunissez vos forces pour fuir, vos pieds manquent la première marche de l&#39;escalier. Vous vous effondrez et tombez jusqu&#39;à l&#39;entre-sol (TBD). 
Confused, you try to push forward, but your body refuses to move.

The smell of lavender thickens, clinging to your skin, your lungs, suffocating you from the inside. You collapse, unable to breathe, and as darkness closes in, you realize too late that you’re no longer running from the ghost—you’ve become one with it, claimed by its lingering curse.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="28" name="Take a look" tags="" position="2300,525" size="100,100">Petrified, you still manage to close your eyes and take a deep, steadying breath, trying to calm your racing heart. The cold air stings your lungs, and that ever-present scent of lavender lingers, but it brings a strange clarity. 
When you open your eyes again, you look more closely at the ghost, its form shifting and flickering in the dim light. Something catches your attention—a small, but unmistakable detail. There, on the edge of its tattered sleeve, you see the faint outline of ink stains, splattered across its fingers.

Your mind races as the pieces click into place. Those are not the hands of a man who wielded a pen for fame, but a man who worked tirelessly in the shadows, writing, drafting, rewriting. The ink-stained hands… the ghost before you isn’t Hale.

Suddenly, the truth hits you with a chilling finality: the body they found, the one beaten beyond recognition, wasn’t Hale at all. It was James Thorpe, the ghostwriter—the true author of The Shadows of Windermere. The victime, killed to keep Hale’s secret buried. 

And now, his ghost stands before you,&#39;&#39; demanding justice&#39;&#39;.

</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="29" name="Last breath" tags="" position="2200,1100" size="100,100">The lavender scent fills the air, growing stronger with each passing second, suffocatingly sweet and oppressive. It clings to your skin, fills your lungs, until you can’t breathe, can’t think of anything but the overpowering fragrance. 

As the ghost descends on you, its cold fingers tightening around your throat, the smell of lavender becomes unbearable—thick, choking, wrapping around you like a shroud. Your vision dims, and the last thing you feel is that sweet, twisted scent drowning you.
You failed in your quest for the truth. You are now part of the curse, bound for eternity to the house and its ghosts.</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="30" name="The Noise" tags="" position="725,800" size="100,100">The steps have started again. You silently leave the library with the oil lamp, your ears on the lookout. You find yourself in the hall and go towards the next door. You take a deep breath, and slowly turn the doorknob. 

The room is completely empty. The sounds no longer to be heard.
All you see is a bed with a small nightstand placed in the middle of the left wall, a washstand in the corner, and old heavy velvet curtains around the single window on the right wall. Nothing else—only complete silence.

Your imagination must have been playing with you. You decide to go back to the library and have a look at the desk.

~~The steps have started again. You silently leave the library, your ears on the lookout. You find yourself in the hall and go towards the next door. You take a deep breath, and slowly turn the doorknob. 
The room is completely empty, a single window on the right wall. No furniture. The sounds no longer to be heard.

There is nothing but a longcase clock. 

You approach, your ears screaming with pain, and what you sees terrifies you. The minute and the hour hands are turning extremely fast, the pendulum not moving a bit. 

You decide to leave and run across the hallway to the other room.


[[To the guest bedroom-&gt;The Guest Bedroom]]</tw-passagedata><tw-passagedata pid="32" name="The wrath" tags="" position="2200,950" size="100,100">Suddenly, the ghost lets out a low, guttural growl, its form beginning to distort, becoming more chaotic and frenzied. The air crackles with fury, and the room darkens, as if the very shadows are feeding off its anger. The ghost’s face twists further, its eyes narrowing in rage. You take a step back, your heart racing.

&quot;No!&quot; the ghost hisses, its voice dripping with venom. 

Petrified, you can&#39;t make any movement. The ghost is now convulsing and its horrible face is moving slowly towards yours. As it does, its contour become clearer, and realization slams into you like a cold wave of dread: this is not Hale. 

The ghost is now inches from your face and rasps in a low voice &quot;You fool!&quot;.
